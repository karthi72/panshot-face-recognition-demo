This is the panshot face recognition prototype for Android, developed alongside the u'smile panshot face database and its evaluations at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria. The prototype uses grayscale images to perform face recognition, sterecameras are not required. Panshot functionality is disabled by default: you can enable it by changing MainActivity:USEF_RONTAL_ONLY from true to false. Be aware that processing panshot samples takes much longer than processing frontal only images.

The prototype was developed for Android 4.3 using OpenCV Android 2.4.8. To build sources corresponding OpenCV sources are needed as a reference project. Fetch OpenCV for Android from http://opencv.org/downloads.html and reference the OpenCV Library project for Android (located in sdk/java/) in the prototype settings (located at Properties-Android, in the list of references). To run the apk OpenCV Manager for Android is required to be installed on the device.
